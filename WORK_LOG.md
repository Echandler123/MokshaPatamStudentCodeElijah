I also wrote pseudocode to try to understand what algorithm I should use. |

| Sept 5  | 10:37 - 11:07 pm  | I tried coding the pseudocode we were given. I tried adding a node class that I could use for my queue that stores the value of the node and the nodes next ot it and the if the node has been visited. I also added a while loop to traverse the queue and remove the current node while adding unvisited nodes next to the current one. I also had the while loop return the total number of moves when it reach what I think is the final node. I also tried filling the nodes and nodes next to each other but I do not think it is correct. |
| Sept 6  |    1:15 - 1:45    |                                                                                                                                                                     I tried editing my code to work with the improved method. I added a map for the snakes and ladders rather than using the 2d arrays given in my while loop. I removed my node class because it was not needed. I added everything to my while loop except for the final check if the node has been visited, adding that node back into the queue, and saving the roll number. |

I also added an array of booleans to check if each node was visited. I also fixed any syntax errors and tried ot make my style more consistent. |
